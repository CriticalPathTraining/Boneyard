The first half of the course focuses on Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010 (SPF2010, formerly known as Windows SharePoint Services or WSS 3.0) where you will learn how to develop fundamental SPF2010 building blocks such as Features, application pages, site pages,  custom list types, site columns, content types, custom workflows and site definitions. 
Thoughout the course students will not only learn how to create robust SharePoint projects and solutions using the new SharePoint Development Tools in Visual Studio 2010, but they will also learn how to customize and extend these tools. In addition developers will learn about the new Sandbox Solution paradigm and best practices around when and how to create robust solutions in this new way of thinking.
Students will also learn how to create Web Parts as well as incorporate some more advanced Web Part development techniques such as custom verbs, asynchronous programming techniques and creating connectable Web Parts.
Microsoft made significant improvements in the ways developers access data in SharePoint both on and off the server. In this course developers will learn how to access data in SharePoint using LINQ for SharePoint when on the server. When connecting to SharePoint from off the server developers will also learn how and when to use the WCF Data Services (aka: OData / REST) and the Client Object Model (.NET, Silverlight and ECMAScript). In addition, developers will also learn how to read, write and surface data in many ways from external systems using the new Business Connectivity Services (BCS, formerly Business Data Catalog (BDC) in SharePoint Server 2007).
This course also address how users can extend the SharePoint Search functionality and experience as well as how to create content-centric solutions using SharePoint Server's Web Content  Management (WCM) and Enterprise Content Management (ECM) capabilities.</my:description><my:courseCode>GSA2010</my:courseCode><my:prerequisites>Attendees should have professional development experience with Visual Studio, the .NET Framework and ASP.NET as well as familiarity with Microsoft Office products such as Word and Excel.
