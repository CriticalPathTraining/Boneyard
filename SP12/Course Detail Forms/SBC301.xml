	<my:title>SharePoint Brand Camp </my:title>
	<my:description>SharePoint Brand Camp is an intensive 3-day course that teaches design techniques and best practices used in branding SharePoint sites. Emphasis is given to techniques that promote ease of deployment and reusability across site collections and across SharePoint farms. You will learn how to customize and extend the built-in CSS files that give SharePoint sites their standard look and feel. You will also learn how to design and implement master pages with modern page layouts using HTML 4.01 instead of the standard HTML 3.2 tables that SharePoint 2007 uses by default. Lab exercises will be completed using the SharePoint Designer, the Internet Explorer and Firefox and you will get hands-on experience using other helpful web design tools such as the IE developer toolbar, firebug and Photoshop. SharePoint Brand Camp will also take a deep dive into the SharePoint development techniques required to package up and deploy your master pages, CSS files and images using SharePoint features and solution packages. This will give you the greatest level of control and flexibility in SharePoint deployment, reusability and versioning. </my:description>
