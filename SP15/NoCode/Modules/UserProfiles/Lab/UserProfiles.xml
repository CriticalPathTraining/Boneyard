	<AboutMe>I was raised in Monterey, CA. I have held many varied jobs, most associated with the ocean or technology (or both). As a diver, I worked in Alaska for a fish hatchery, for a cruise line as a hyperbaric chamber operator and dive boat captain in the Caribbean, and for the University of California, Santa Cruz as a dive technician at Long Marine Laboratory. My wife, Mary Jane, and I met on that cruise ship in the Caribbean and moved to Austin in '98 for the live music and food (and for the chance to work with Sam and Liam). We enjoy spending our weekends outdoors usually swimming my dog in Barton Creek and "beer tasting" at one of the local dog-friendly watering holes. 
	I enjoy anything related to the outdoors, especially if it involves my wife, my dog, frosty cold beverages or shooting, but not necessarily at the same time or in that order.</AboutMe>

	<AboutMe>I was born in Navarre Florida and whisked away to start my Search and Rescue training in Austin, TX. I am excited to be trained by my sister, Willa who works in Recovery. What I lack in experience I make up for in exuberance and a "Great Nose".</AboutMe>
